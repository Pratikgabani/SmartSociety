While the core functionality is production-grade, some commit history and structuring may not fully reflect professional standards due to the experimental nature of the development process.

## 🎯 Motivation & Learning Outcomes

This project was created in our 2nd year of Computer Engineering to learn:
- Full-stack MERN development
- Payment gateway integration
- Authentication flows (manual + OAuth)
- Real-world deployment considerations
- Working collaboratively in a team with Git

We intentionally pushed frequently to test features, debug fast, and keep velocity high — which led to a heavy and occasionally unstructured commit history. This was a deliberate tradeoff in favor of rapid learning.
